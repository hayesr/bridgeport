# What is this?

This is a super-simple CMS built on Mercury Editor http://jejacks0n.github.com/mercury/ and MongoDB.

It's still a work in progress.


##### Why MongoDB?
Is it because the Interwebz said it has WEBSCALE?? :scream: ÑNo. In CMS's I've worked with in the past, when a page is rendered a bunch of joins are performed to get the main content and various blocks and pieces together. The idea of a schema-less document-store database seems to fit better here. Plus, building anything without worrying about the schema is wonderful.

##### Why Mercury Editor?
My use case involves users who are pretty confortable with M$ Word, but the notion of admin-modes and TinyMCE boxes is hard for them to follow. It's a huge usability boost when the final content looks exactly like it did when they entered the content.

Mercury provides a familiar-enough toolbar at the top, and the editiable zones are clearly marked.

Also worth noting is that I can dictate that they use anything but Internet Explorer.
